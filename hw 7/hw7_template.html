<h1>Homework 7: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Quentin McCalla</h2>
<h3>I decided to make a chloropeth of Nevada. I was born and raised there but didn't know much
    about the northern part of the state. I knew it was rural but I was curious how much of the 
    population worked in careers involving the natural resources.
